	  <h4>Import Data: </h4>
	  <p> To begin with, we use a stringstream class to read in data from OFF files. We first create two arrays(vector) of Vertex pointers and Face pointers.
	    For each vertex, we create a Vertex on the heap and pass in its coordinates x, y, z in the space. At the same time, we set the vertex with its index
	    on the vector array. And, for each face, we create a Face on the heap passing in the vertiex pointers by getting them from the vertices array
	    using index parsed from the file. After parsing, we dump all the positions from Vertices and the indices from Faces from vector to array.
	    Then, pass the arrays to VBO and EBO for OpenGL to render the model.
	  </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <h4>Mesh Perception: </h4>
	  <p> In order to test out the normal calculation and the mesh simplification, we need to have a way to "feel" the differences between a coarse mesh
	    model and a fine mesh model. We conquer this goal by using a gouraud shading. Using gouraud shading, we can see the diffusive light and  the
	    specular high light varies on different faces to give us some perception of meshes structure under lighting.
	    And also, by such approach we are able to test out our normal calculations. What's more, for better seeing the meshes structure, we enable
	    the wireframe model in the Opengl initialization. You can toggle it by pressing 'F5' key to switch bettween the modes.

	  <p>To interact with the model, we create a FPS like experimence to wonder around the scence using 'w', 'a', 's' and 'd' keys to move the position
	    and the mouse to rotate the view angles. We first set up a Camera class to calculate the view matrix according to the camera object's position in the space and its focus on the scence. We let the Camera class process our input by passing in the glfw window pointer and adjust its position and
	    view angles according to the inputs. Then, in the game loop, before drawing, we update our View matrix using Camra object. As well as, passing,
	    camera position to shader for rendering the light.
	    In order for you to get the mouse out of the program, you can press 'F6' to toggle the mouse from the scene.

	  <h4>Overall View: </h4>
	  <p> To implement a good data structure, the mesh manipulation is not the only one key we need to deal with. The runtime of edge collapsing and
	    vertices splitting, the memory managements of deleting faces and vertices and the property maintaing of the connectivity can also be other
	    three important conerns for the code to be simple and maintainable and for the program to run fast enough to do the simplication on meshes and
	    progressive model. The follwing picture is the UML diagram of our datastructure relationships.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The connectivity information is retrived by accesing the adjacency lists of Face and Vertex objects.	    
	    Each face is holding an adjacency array of the vertices pointers that is included. And, each vertercies is holding an adjacency array of the
	    faces that included it.
	    While Errdge is only used for storing the information of two vertercies to be collapsed, the position of new merged vertices and the corrosponding
	    error, it has no essential role of the mesh strucutures. It can be recalculated after each removal of edges. Thus, it can be a stack objects.

	  <h4>Run-time Analysis: </h4>
	  <ol>
	    <li >
	      <p class="m-0">Per Operation: </p>
	      <p>
		Apart from popping the "edge" with the least error which would take O(logN), anyother operation on Vertices array and Faces set only take O(N)
		on average
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p class="m-0">Total Operations: </p>
	      <p>
		Among each update on set and priority queue as well as dumpping, they all require O(N). O(N) for invalid vertices and faces deletion from the
		heap. O(N) for recalculating edges with error from faces. O(N) for building priority heap on an array. O(N) for moving data from adavanced
		data structures	to regular array for dumpping. For edges' removals, collapsing N edges will take O(NlogN) at most.

	    </li>
	  </ol>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <h4>Memory Management: </h4>
	  <p>In collapsing edges function, we mark each vertercies and faces that are not going to be rendered as dead. And after removals, in updateVFsets
	    function, we update each vertercies and faces status to remove their dead adjacent vertercies and faces from the array. Then, mark the face and
	    vertex with 0 adjacency as dead again. Afterawrd, push each dead vertercies and faces to a set for later deletion of them from the memory. Then,
	    we dump the rest of vertercies and faces for rendering.

	  <h4>Edge Collapsing Function: </h4>
	  <p>
	    In our implementation, the edge collasping function take in a Errdge object. We first retrive two vertercies to be removed from the object and
	    make a new vertex on heap by using the new positoin with least error from the object.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Let the two vertices to be removed be v1, v2 and the new vertex be v'.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    For each face from v1's adjacent list, we check against all faces from v2's adjacent list. If the face doesn't include v2 vertex, we replace
	    v1's place in adjacent list with v. We do the same thing for v2's adjacent list. If a face happens to include v1 and v2, we terminate the face.
	    Then, add new Errdges(Edges with Error) calculated using error matrics onto priority queue. In the end, we terminate v1 and v2.
	  </p>
	</li>


	<li>
	  <h4>Corner Case(Triangle Shape's Triangle Fan): </h4>
	    <p>
	      The algorithm described above is not enough for some special cases, which can lead to a fin appear on the surface of the model making model
	      look disasterous and also influence the error matrics calculation on some areas. See the following picture taken from the assignment write-up.

	      </div>
	    </div>
	    
	    <h5>Our Solution: </h5>
          <p>We can observe from the picture that the fin is caused by two faces sharing three vertices after the edge collasping.
	    Thus, we can further
	    remove the faces, that includes v', which share the same three vertices
	  </p>
	  <p>Implemnetation Detail: </p>
	  <p>After, we merge our the edges incidents to v1 & v2 to v'. We need to check the neightbor face's adjacent lists of vertices.
	    We use a nested-for loop to compare each face against one another. We use an unoder set to keep track of all the vertices that we have seen so far.
	    If after we insert all the vertices into the set from two different active faces, teh size still remains 3, that means we have two faces sharing
	    three vertices. Then, we mark two faces as dead by calling terminate() function. Then, we update the neight vertices and v'.

	  <h4>Error Quadric Calculation: </h4>
	  <p> To preserve the shape of the mesh when do simplication, we need to find an optimal vertex where an edge collapses to. In order to do so, we need to
	    find a way to calculate the error caused by a collapse of edges and minimize the error during the process of simplification. In this assignment, we
	    record the error based on a point-to-plane error quadric scheme. In a word, we first calculate the planes equation around the edge(vertex v1 and
	    vertex v2). Then, we calculate the distance between the new merged vertex v0(where v1 and v2 converge to due to the edge collapsing) and all the
	    planes around v1 and v2. The sum of the distance will be the error introduced to the mesh simplification. We then calculate the derivative of the
	    error with respect to x, y and z in the space. Making the derivative 0, we can find the minimum error of a new point (x',y',z') where
	    E(x',y',z') = 0. Then, the new point is the idea vertex we want the edge collapses to.
	  </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <h4>Algorithm Overview & Function Explianation:  </h4>
	  <p> In our constructor of Mesh, before we dump everything to VBO. We call updatePQ() to calculate all the edges to be collapsed with the optimal point that they converge to using function optimalEdge.
	    The optimalEdge function will take in two vertices and calculate the errorMatrics first using errorMatrics function. Then, we find the optimal
	    position using the calculation process described above.
	    The edge with error and optimal position is packed using Errdge class object and is pushed to priority queue.
	    The priority queue will have all edges with the least error on the top of the queue.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>  Here, we are ready to do edge collasping. In our removeEdges function, we basically collapse all edges of the mesh until there is nothing left
	    in the priority queue. And store each new vertex into a queue for later splitting(progressive meshing). When we remove one edge, we pop one edge
	    out from priority queue. Check if it's valid(two vertices of the ending is not collapsed before). If valid, we call collapseEdge function on it.
	    Else, keep popping until we find a valid edge to be collapsed on.	    
	  </p>
	  <p>Notation: F(V0) : set of faces of v0. (Adjacency list of V0) </p>
	  <p>Notation: F1(V0): set of faces of v0. (Adjacency list of V0 where it contains the face where ancestor v1 used to have) </p>
	  <p>Notation: F2(V0): set of faces of v0. (Adjacency list of V0 where it contains the face where ancestor v2 used to have) </p>
	  <p> In our collapseEdge function, we extract information of two vertices to be merged and the optimal position to be merged.
	    We first create a new vertex on the heap called v0.
	    We set v0's ancestor v1 and v2 to current v1 and v2 pointer. (For part 5, more on this later.)
	    We go over the faces of v1 and v2. Mark faces that contains v1 and v2 dead. And replace v1 in F(V1)'s vertices adjacency list with v0 and
	    replace v2 in F(V2)'s vertices adjacency list with v0. At the same time, add faces from F(V1) and F(V2) to F(V0) and add F(V1) to F1(V0)
	    and F(V2) to F2(V0).
	    Then we do the fin removals.
	    And recalculate the normals of faces near to v0.
	    Recalculate the normals of vertices near to v0 and v0.
	    Then, we calculate new optimal edges(edge with errors and optimal position after converge) and push them to the priority queue for later
	    edge removals.
	  </p>
	  <p> After removing all edges of the mesh, we call updateVFSets() to store the valid faces and vertercies for later dumpping.</p>

	  <h4>Some Notes: </h4>
	  <p> In the following pictures, I present some mesh simplication of different degrees on Armadillo model. </p>
	  <p> Later on, we will do a progessive meshing and simplication without calculations in part 5, where you can see the animation of
