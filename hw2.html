		<h4>Skeleton Code: </h4>
		<p> The base code of our program is taken from the provided skeleton code in the previous iterations of the CSE 167 class. 
		This code contains the basic initialization process to set up an OpenGL window. We build upon this code by adding a file parser, a Mesh class, and basic shaders. 
		As a result, the program is able to display the model, centered and scaled to a 10x10x10 cube, on a solid black background. 
		</p>

	  <h4>Mesh Perception: </h4>
	  <p> In order to test out the normal calculation and the mesh simplification, we need to have a way to "feel" the differences between a coarse mesh
	    model and a fine mesh model. We conquer this obstacle by using Gouraud shading. This shading allows us to see the diffuse and
	    specular highlights, which varies on different faces. It also gives the mesh structure depth and perception under basic lighting.
	    This approach enables us to test out our normal calculations. What's more, to better see the mesh structure, we enable
	    the wireframe modeling in the OpenGL initialization. You can toggle it by pressing 'F5' key to switch between the modes.

	    and the mouse to rotate the view angle. We do this by first setting up a Camera class to calculate the view matrix according to the camera's position in space and its focus on the scence. 
	    We let the Camera class process our keyboard and mouse input and adjust its position and
	    view angle according to these inputs. Then, in the game loop, before drawing, we update our wiew matrix using the Camera class. Also, the camera position is given to the shader for rendering the lighting.
	    In order for you to control the use of the mouse, you can press 'F6' to enable/disable the mouse.

	  <h4>Overview: </h4>
	  <p> To implement a good data structure, the mesh manipulation is not the only key we need to deal with. The runtime of an edge collapse and a
	    vertex split, the memory management of faces and vertices, and the proper maintenance of the connectivity structure are also
	    three important concerns. Making the code simple allows it to be maintainable and fast enough to perform the mesh simplification and
	    progressive meshes. The follwing picture is the simplified UML diagram of our data structure relationship.
	  </p>
		
	  <p>
	    For the reasons stated above, we decided to use the simple adjacency list data structure. We have three main classes: Vertex, Face, and Mesh. 
	    Each of these classes represent what their names suggest (i.e. Vertex represents a vertex). The Mesh class is the container class which holds a list of vertices and faces that make up the mesh, 
	    and the connectivity information is stored within the Face and Vertex classes. That is to say,     
	    each Face holds a list of Vertex pointers that make up the face, while each Vertex holds a list of the
	    Faces that are adjacent to it. Errdge, on the other hand, is a supplementary class that is only used for storing the information of an edge collapse. 
	    This includes the two vertices that make up the edge, the position of new merged vertex, and the error corresponding to the edge collapse. 
	    This class facilitates the recalculation of the error whenever a new edge is collapsed, making it a good auxiliary class for containers such as stacks or queues.

	</li>
	      
	<li>
	  <h4>Data Import: </h4>
	  <p> To read in the model's data from the OFF files, we mainly use a stringstream class. We first create a Mesh object, which contains an array of Vertex pointers and another array of Face pointers.
	    For each line in the file specifying a vertex, we create a Vertex object on the heap, pass in its x, y, and z coordinates, and add this to the Mesh. Next, for each line in the file specifying a face, we create a Face object on the heap, pass in the Vertex pointers from the Mesh's vertex array
	    using the indices parsed from the file, and add this Face to the Mesh. We then add this Face to the adjacency list of each of its vertices. After parsing (and after every edge collapse or vertex split), we dump all the positions of the vertices and all the indices of the faces' vertices from the Mesh to an array.
	    This array is then passed to the VBO and EBO for OpenGL to render the model.
	  </p>
	</li>
	      
	
	  <h4>Run-time Analysis: </h4>
	  <ol>
	    <li >
	      <p class="m-0">Picking an Edge: </p>
	      <p>
		To store the Errdge objects, we use a priority queue. Initializing this priority queue with all the possible edges takes a single O(N log N) time. Picking an edge in each iteration of an edge collapse takes O(log N) time. And finally, adding the new edges (after collapsing edges) will also take O(log N) time.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p class="m-0">Updating Adjacency List: </p>
	      <p>
		Because we deal with pointers and only update locally, with respect to the edge, updating the adjacency list should run in constant time. 
		To update the adjcency list of the faces and vertices that were affected by the edge collapse, we only have to replace the pointer information, which is just a value assignment. The total number of faces and vertices that have to be updated is also constant since they are simply the neighbors of the vertices that were collapsed. 
		As for the faces that collapse as a result of the edge collapse, we toggle a flag in the object that indicates the face being invalid and not part of the simplified model. These show that updating the adjacency list takes constant time.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p class="m-0">Total: </p>
	      <p>
		 From the analyses above, performing an edge collapse will take O(log N) time with respect to the number of edges. However, we note that for smaller values, recalculating the error and optimal vertex position might dominate the run time since it uses matrix operations. 
		 As for vertex splits, the runtime should be constant since we maintain a history stack that shows which vertices split into which other vertices. This means that there is no calculation required for vertex splits.
	      </p>
	    </li>   
	  </ol>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <h4>Memory Management: </h4>
	  <p>In the edge collapse function, instead of deleting, we mark each vertex and face that are not going to be rendered as "dead". These "dead" vertices and faces are then skipped when transferring the vertices and faces into arrays for the VBO and EBO.
	     The reason we did this is because of two things, simplifying the vertex split function and consolidating the dynamic memory. By keeping the "dead' vertices and faces, we avoid having to recreate these objects and instead, simply toggle a flag. 
	     Also, by keeping these dynamically allocated objects in a single container, we avoid having to release memory in many different places in the code. Instead, freeing the memory can be done in the end, with a simple for loop.
	  </p>

	  <h4>Edge Collapsing Algorithm: </h4>
	  <p>
	    In our implementation, the edge collase function takes in a Errdge object. We first retrieve the two vertices to be removed from the Errdge and
	    instantiate a new vertex on the heap by using the new position with the least error, which is already calculated in the Errdge object.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Let the two vertices to be removed be v1, v2 and the new vertex to be v'.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    For each face in both v1's and v2's adjacent list, we find the common faces and terminate them. Next, for the remaining faces that were not terminated, we replace v1 or v2 with v' from the face's adjacency list. 
	    We then update the normals of these remaining faces to reflect the new vertex. 
	    Following that, we iterate through each of the neighbors (vertices in the adjacency list of the faces that are in the adjacency list of the new vetex) and update their adjacency list (remove any terminated faces) and their normals.
	    Lastly, we make new Errdges(Edges with Error) between the new vertex and its neighbors. This includes calculating the error matrics and adding these Errdges into the priority queue structure. In the end, we also terminate v1 and v2 in order to not render them.
	  </p>
	</li>


	<li>
	  <h4>Corner Case (Fins): </h4>
	    <p>
	      The algorithm described above is not enough for some special cases, which can lead to a fins appearing on the surface of the model, making the model
	      appear disasterous and also influencing the error matrics calculation in some areas. See the following picture taken from the assignment write-up.
	    </p>

	      </div>
	    </div>
	    
	    <h5>Our Solution: </h5>
          <p>We observe from the pictures that the fin is caused by two faces sharing the same vertex set after the edge collapse.
	    This gives us a simple algorithm to detect these fins and remove them accordingly.
	  </p>
		
	  <p>Adding on to the edge collapse algorithm above, just after we replace v1 or v2 with v', we check for possible fins.
	    We do this through the use of a nested-for loop that compares each face adjacent to v' with every other face adjacent to v'. 
	    For each pair of faces, we add both faces' adjacent vertices into an unordered set. If, after inserting all the vertices from two different active faces into the set, the size of the set still remains as 3, it means that these two faces share the same vertex set (both are fins).
	    Ins this case, we terminate both faces. After checking for fins, we continue with the algorithm above and update the faces and neighboring vertices.

	  <h4>Error Quadric Calculation: </h4>
	  <p> To preserve the shape of the mesh when simplifying, we need to find an optimal vertex where an edge collapses to. In order to do so, we need to
	    find a way to calculate the error caused by an edge collapse and minimize the error during the process of simplification. In this assignment, we
	    record the error based on a point-to-plane error quadric scheme. In other words, we first calculate the plane's equation around the edge(vertex v1 and
	    vertex v2). Then, we calculate the distance between the new merged vertex v' (where v1 and v2 converge to due to the edge collapse) and all the
	    planes around v1 and v2. The sum of the distance will be the error introduced to the mesh simplification. We then calculate the derivative of the
	    error with respect to x, y, and z in space. Equating the derivative to 0 allows us to find the minimum error of a new point (x',y',z') where
	    E(x',y',z') = 0. This new point is the ideal vertex we want the edge collapses to in order to minimize the error and preserve the shape of the model.
	  </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <h4>Algorithm Overview & Function Explanation:  </h4>
	  <p> In the constructor of our Mesh class, after we parse the OFF file and calculate the normals for each face and vertex, we call the updatePQ function to calculate the optimal vertex and error metrics for all the edges using the function optimalEdge.
	    The optimalEdge function takes in two vertices and calculates the errorMetrics first using the errorMetrics function. Then, we find the optimal
	    position using the calculation process described above.
	    The edge, along with the error metrics and optimal position, is packed using an Errdge object and is pushed into a priority queue.
	    This priority queue will have all the edges in the model, with the edge holding the least error on the front of the queue. 
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>  After initializing the priority queue, we are ready to do some edge collapsing. In our removeEdges function, we basically collapse all edges of the mesh until there is nothing left
	    in the priority queue.  When we remove one edge, we pop one edge out from priority queue. We check to see if it's valid (the two vertices composing the edge have not been collapsed before). If the Errdge is valid, we call the collapseEdge function on it.
	    Else, we keep popping until we find a valid edge to collapse.	    
	  </p>
	  <p>Notation: F(v') : set of faces of v'. (Adjacency list of v') </p>
	  <p>Notation: F1(v'): set of faces of v'. (Adjacency list of v' which contains the faces ancestor v1 used to have) </p>
	  <p>Notation: F2(v'): set of faces of v'. (Adjacency list of v' which contains the faces ancestor v2 used to have) </p>
	  <p> In our collapseEdge function, we extract the information from Errdge about which two vertices to merge and where the optimal position is.
	    We first create a new vertex on the heap v' that is at the optimal position.
	    We then set v''s ancestors v1 and v2 to the current v1 and v2 pointer. (For part 5, more on this later.)
	    Next, we go over the faces of v1 and v2. We terminate faces that contains both v1 and v2, and we replace v1 in F(v1)'s vertex adjacency list with v' and
	    replace v2 in F(v2)'s vertex adjacency list with v'. At the same time, we assign F(v') = F(v1) + F(v2), F1(v') = F(v1), and F2(v') = F(v2).
	    Then we remove the fins and recalculate the normals of both the neighboring faces and vertices of v'.
	    Lastly, we create Errdge for all the new edges (calculate the errors and find optimal position) and push them into the priority queue for subsequent
	    edge removals.
	  </p>
	  <p> After removing all the edges of the mesh, we call the updateVFSets function to store the valid faces and vertices for later dumping.</p>

	  <p> In the following pictures, we present some mesh simplication of different degrees on the Armadillo model. </p>

		<h4>Vertex Split Algorithm: </h4>
		<p> To simplify the vertex split function, we add some extra fields in the Vertex class. This includes two pointers to the vertices it is merged from (ancestors v1 and v2) and a pointer to the vertex it merges to. 
		In addition to that, five new adjacency lists are added: one for the faces common to both v1 and v2, one for the faces adjacent to only v1, another for the faces adjacent to only v2, one for the faces adjacent to v1 that became fins, 
		and another for the faces adjacent to v2 that became fins. Aside from these, we also add a stack in the Mesh class that represents the history of edge collapses. It stores the v' in each iteration of the edge collapse function.
		</p>
		
		<p> Doing these greatly simplifies the vertex split process, such that it becomes a question of updating the adjacency list. 
		To split a vertex v', we iterate through each of the adjacency lists and reverse the update process done in the edge collapse function. For the faces that are adjacent to only either v1 or v2, 
		we replace v' with the respective vertex in the face's adjacency list. For the faces common to both v1 and v2, we simply have them reborn (opposite of terminate) and add the face back to all of its vertices' adjacency list. 
		As for the fins, we do all three: have the face be reborn, replace v' with the respective vertex, and add the face back to all its vertices' adjacency list. Next, we recalculate both the faces' and the neighboring vertices' normals. 
		Lastly, we terminate the merged vertex v' and revive the previous vertices v1 and v2.
